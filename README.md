Crew Member Prediction

Hyundai Heavy Industry is one of the worldâ€™s largest manufacturers of large ships including cruise liners. 
They need accurate estimates of how many crew members a ship will require.

This project creates a model to predict how many crew members the ship will need. The dataset is provided by the UCI. 

Entire project is developed using PySpark and Databricks Community edition notebook.
